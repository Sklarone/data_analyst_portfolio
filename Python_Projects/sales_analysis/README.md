This project is focused on analyzing the Brazilian E-commerce dataset from Kaggle, with an emphasis on key customer, financial, and transactional metrics. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the goal is to demonstrate skills in handling and analyzing large datasets and deriving valuable insights for business decision-making.

In this analysis, I will explore the following:

Customer Metrics: The total number of customers, distribution of customers across geographical regions, and the average customer lifespan.
Financial Metrics: Overview of sales performance, total revenue, average order value, and revenue distribution by product category.
Orders and Transactions: Total number of orders, average number of orders per customer, and the impact of order delivery time on customer satisfaction and loyalty.
The analysis is performed using essential Python libraries such as:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization and creating insightful charts and graphs.
This project is an example of how I apply my data analytics skills, focusing on customer and financial metrics, and leveraging Python tools for data manipulation and visualization. It is part of my growing portfolio as a Junior Data Analyst.
